# Seattle Airbnb Analysis
## Overview

This project aims to explore various aspects of Airbnb listings in Seattle, focusing on factors that influence pricing, guest reviews, and the success of listings. The analysis is driven by three key business questions:

1.  **What aspects are most determinant of the price of an Airbnb listing in Seattle?**
2.  **What are the key factors influencing guest reviews and ratings for Airbnb listings in Seattle?**
3.  **What is the impact of host attributes (such as responsiveness, number of listings, and experience) on the success of Airbnb listings in Seattle?**

## Motivation for the Project

The Airbnb market in Seattle is competitive, with thousands of listings available at any given time. Understanding what drives success in this marketplace can provide valuable insights for hosts looking to optimize their listings and for potential investors in the short-term rental market. The primary motivation behind this project is to explore and analyze the key factors that influence pricing, guest satisfaction, and overall success on Airbnb. By answering these questions, the project aims to help hosts improve their offerings and make data-driven decisions that enhance the profitability and attractiveness of their listings.
