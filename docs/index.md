## **Introduction**

The Airbnb market in Seattle is a bustling and dynamic space. With thousands of listings, both hosts and guests are looking for ways to optimize their experiences. This analysis dives into three critical questions to uncover the key factors that make an Airbnb listing successful. We will explore what drives pricing, guest satisfaction, and overall success, providing insights that are valuable for hosts, guests, and potential investors alike.

## **Question 1: What Aspects Are Most Determinant of the Price of an Airbnb Listing in Seattle?**

### **Explanation**

Pricing is a crucial factor for both hosts and guests. Our analysis reveals that the type of property, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and the location (neighborhood) play significant roles in determining the price of a listing. Seasonal demand also impacts pricing, with prices generally higher during peak tourist seasons.

Experience matters tooâ€”hosts who have been on the platform longer generally have better occupancy rates and reviews. These attributes suggest that experienced and active hosts are better at managing their listings to meet guest expectations.
